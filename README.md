# Cap'n Proto bindings for Node.js

This package is a hacky wrapper around the [Cap'n Proto](http://capnproto.org)
C++ library.  Both the serialization and the RPC layer are exposed.

This wrapper was created primarily for use in the implementation of
[Sandstorm](http://sandstorm.io), whose frontend is written using
[Meteor](http://meteor.com).

## Caveats

### This implementation is SLOW

Because v8 cannot inline or otherwise optimize calls into C++ code, and because
the C++ bindings are implemented in terms of the "dynamic" API, this
implementation is actually very slow.  In fact, the main advantage of Cap'n
Proto -- the ability to use the wire format as an in-memory format -- does not
apply here, because accessor overhead of such an approach would be too high.
Instead, this implementation is based on decoding messages to native Javascript
objects in an upfront parsing step, and conversely initializing outgoing
messages from complete Javascript objects.  This actually makes the library
somewhat nicer syntactically than it would be otherwise, but it is not fast.

A pure-Javascript implementation would likely be much faster.  See
[capnp-js](https://github.com/capnp-js) for such an
implementation.  Unfortunately, that implementation is incomplete and does not
support [RPC](https://github.com/capnp-js/rpc) just yet.  Hence, this hack was 
created for short-term use.

Eventually, we expect to replace this implementation with a pure-Javascript
implementation, or perhaps a hybrid that at least has inlinable accessors and
avoids runtime string map lookups.

### The interface is not final

Especially because of the above caveat, we expect the interface may change
in the future.

## Installation

### From NPM

    npm install capnp

Note that the C++ part of the module is built during the install process.  Thus,
you must have development headers for Cap'n Proto and Node.js installed, along
with the `node-gyp` tool and a GCC new enough for Cap'n Proto (at least 4.7).
On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install these like so:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs-dev nodejs-legacy capnproto-dev g++

### From source

    git clone git://github.com/capnproto/node-capnp.git
    cd node-capnp
    npm install

Note: node-capnp uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) for
building. To manually invoke the build process, you can use `node-gyp rebuild`.
This will put the compiled extension in `build/Release/capnp.node`. However,
when you do `require('capnp')`, it will expect the module to be in, for
example, `bin/linux-x64-v8-3.11/capnp.node`. You can manually put the module
here every time you build (or symlink it), or you can use the included build
script. Either `npm install` or `node build -f` will do this for you. If you
are going to be hacking on node-capnp, it may be worthwhile to first do
`node-gyp configure` and then for subsequent rebuilds you can just do
`node-gyp build` which will be faster than a full `npm install` or
`node-gyp rebuild`.

(If the above paragraph looks familiar, it's because it comes from
[node-fibers](http://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers), whose build approach
we copied.)

## Usage

### Loading the module

    var capnp = require("capnp");

### Loading schemas

    // Schemas are parsed at runtime.  Once "capnp" has been imported, you can
    // load schemas using require().  You can omit the ".capnp" suffix if you
    // prefer.
    var foo = require("./foo.capnp");
    
    // If you'd rather not rely on hooking require() (a deprecated -- but
    // probably permanent -- feature of Node), you can use capnp.import(), but
    // this makes relative imports uglier:
    var foo = capnp.import(__dirname + "/foo.capnp");
    
    // capnp.import() takes an exact file name.  If you want to search the
    // import path, use importSystem().  This searches the usual Node module
    // locations as well as standard places to install .capnp files (i.e.
    // /usr/include and /usr/local/include).
    var schema = capnp.importSystem("capnp/schema.capnp");

### Parsing / serializing messages

    var obj = capnp.parse(foo.SomeStruct, inputBuffer);
    var outputBuffer = capnp.serialize(foo.SomeStruct, obj);

### Connecting to RPC servers

    // connect() accepts the same address string format as kj::Network.
    var conn = capnp.connect("localhost:1234");

    // restore() is like EzRpc::importCap()
    var cap = conn.restore("exportName", foo.MyInterface);

### Making an RPC call
    
    // Method parameters are native Javascript values, converted using the
    // same rules as capnp.serialize().
    var promise = cap.someMethod("foo", 123, {a: 1, b: 2});

    // Methods return ES6 "Promise" objects.  The response is a Javascript
    // object containing the results by name.
    promise.then(function(response) {
      console.log(response.namedResult);
    })
    // If the remote object throws an rpc exception, the promise will be
    // rejected. The error returned will have a property `kjType`, which
    // will be a string representation of the exception's `type` field.
    .catch(function(error) {
        switch(error.kjType) {
        case 'failed':
            console.log("A generic problem occurred:", error.message);
            break;
        case 'overloaded':
            console.log("Resource overload on the remote end:", error.message);
            break;
        case 'disconnected':
            // ...
            break;
        case 'unimplemented':
            // ...
            break;
        }
    });

### Pipelining

    // Pipelining is supported.
    promise.anotherMethod();

    // You can explicitly close capabilities and connections if you don't want
    // to wait for the garbage collector to do it.
    cap.close();
    conn.close();

### Implementing an interface

Create a Javascript object with methods corresponding to the interface, and
just pass that object anywhere where a capability is expected.  Methods can
return promises.

For instance, given:

    interface Foo {
      foo @0 (a: Text, b: Int32) -> (c: Text);
    }

    interface Bar {
      bar @0 (foo :Foo) -> ();
    }

You could write:

    // Implement the Foo interface.
    var myFoo = {
      foo: function (a, b) {
        return {c: "blah"};
      }
    }

    // Use it in a call.
    someBar.bar(myFoo);

Cap'n Proto protocols often depend on explicit notification when there are
no more references to an object. In C++ this would be accomplished by
implementing a destructor, but of course Javascript is garbage collected.
Instead, you may give your object a `close()` method, which will be called
as soon as there are no more references.

    var myFoo = {
      foo: function (a, b) {
        return {c: "blah"};
      },
      close: () {
        console.log("client disconnected");
      }
    }

Note, however, that `close()` will be called once for every time your
native object is coerced to a capability. So, if you did:

    someBar.bar(myFoo);
    someBar.bar(myFoo);

Then `myFoo.close()` will eventually be called twice. To prevent this,
you can explicitly convert your object to a capability once upfront, and
then use that:

    var cap = new capnp.Capability(myFoo, mySchema.Foo);

    someBar.bar(cap);
    someBar.bar(cap);

    // Close our own copy of the reference. Note that this does not
    // necessarily call `myFoo.close()` -- that happens only after the
    // two copies passed to the `bar()` calls above have also been closed.
    cap.close();

In this case, the library only wraps `myFoo` as a capability once, and then
calls `close()` once all copies of that reference have been dropped.

If one of your methods throws an exception, or returns a promise which
is subsequently rejected, it will be converted to a capnproto rpc
exception. If the exception has a `kjType` property, that will be used
for the exception's `type` field, otherwise the type will be `failed`.

    var myBar = {
        bar: function(foo) {
            if(!bazAvailable()) {
                var err = new Error("The baz is busy; try again later.");
                err.kjType = 'overloaded';
                throw(err);
            }
            // ...
        }
    }

### Exporting a bootstrap capability

    // Connect to another server and export `myFoo` as a bootstrap capability.
    var newConn = capnp.connect("localhost:4321",
                                new capnp.Capability(myFoo, mySchema.Foo));

### Accepting RPC connections

Not implemented.  Currently you can only be a client, not a server.  (But you
*can* implement capabilities as a client.)
